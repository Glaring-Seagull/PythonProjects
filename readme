This is a collection of small Python projects that where made for practice and personaly documentation. 

Lots of these samples come from or were inspired by Automate The Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart, some of them are my own creations. 

I hope this collection can work as my own documentation for Python and eventually something I can confidenetly direct strangers to knowing they wont wince too badly at how poorly everything is programed!
