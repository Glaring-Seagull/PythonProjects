This is a collection of small Python projects that where made for practice and personal documentation. Some of them are years old but never made it into a repo until now! 

Lots of these samples come from or were inspired by Automate The Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart, some of them are my own creations. 

I hope this collection can work as my own documentation for Python and eventually something I can confidenetly direct strangers to knowing they wont wince too badly at how poorly everything is programed!
